This document contains all steps in order to initialize the Hedgehog Software Controller.

====================================================================================================

If you just need to initialize an SD card, you may want to use the image of an existing SD card and just copy it onto the new SD card.
This can be done via executing the following steps:

1) Insert SD card to PC and check which devices (partitions) are mounted via 
df -h
On the Hedgehog Development PC it is mostly /dev/sdb which is assumed subsequently.

2) Unmount all partitions from the SD card. On a new SD card there is just one partition that is unmounted via
sudo umount /dev/sdb1

3) Copy the existing image onto the new SD card via
sudo dd bs=4M if=hedgehogswc.img of=/dev/sdb
given that the SD card device is sdb

4) To prepare the HedgehogSWC Software, put the SD card into the Development PC and pull the repository using Smartgit.

5) Start the Raspberry PI with the SD card and set the correct time using for example
sudo date -s "Jul 5 08:10"
and build the HedgehogSWC software via 
make clean
make

TODO: TO BE REVISITED (INCLUDE SETTING TIME AND REVIEW STEPS)
On the other hand, if you want to configure everything from scratch, do the following steps:

1) Initialize SD card with Raspbian operating system (source: https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/linux.md)
   - Insert SD card to PC and check which devices (partitions) are mounted via 
     df -h
     On the Hedgehog Development PC it is mostly /dev/sdb which is assumed subsequently.
   - Unmount all partitions from the SD card. On a new SD card there is just one partition that is unmounted via
     sudo umount /dev/sdb1
   - Write the Raspbian image to the SD card:
     sudo dd bs=4M if=~/Desktop/2015-02-16-raspbian-wheezy.img of=/dev/sdb
   - Remove SD card

2) Start the Raspberry PI with the initialized SD card for the first time and make the following configurations in the config tool:
   - 1 Expand Filesystem
   - 2 Change User Password: pi
   - 3 Enable Boot: Desktop Log in as user "pi" at the graphical desktop
   - 4 Internalization Options: Change timezone to Vienna
   - 8 Advanced options: A8 Serial Disable!
   
3) Put the SD card back into the Hedgehog Development PC 

4) In order to set the keyboard layout right, change in the /etc/default/keyboard file 
   XKBLAYOUT=”gb”
   to
   XKBLAYOUT=”de”

5) Clone the HedgehogSWC repository at ssh://git@nas.krofitsch.at/Hedgehog/HedgehogSWC into /home/pi/HedgehogSWC.

6) Setup automatic software building at startup by adding the following line to /etc/rc.local:
   sudo -u pi make --directory=/home/pi/HedgehogSWC
   TODO this does not work properly. Check that! Maybe because of time?

7) Edit /home/pi/.config/openbox/lxde-rc.xml in order to set lxterminal to maximize
   Therefore, add
   
   <application name="lxterminal">
        <fullscreen>yes</fullscreen>
   </application>

   before the closing </applications> tag at the end of the file.

8) To configure autostart, add the following line to /etc/xdg/lxsession/LXDE-pi/autostart:
   @lxterminal --working-directory=/home/pi/HedgehogSWC --command ./andrixswc
   
9) Check if everything worked! Startup the Raspberry PI with a connected HDMI screen. After startup, check if it shows a terminal in fullscreen mode with the initial output from the Hedgehog software, beginning with “Hedgehog successfully started”.
